Setup and Installation
To run this portfolio locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Profile.git
cd Profile


Open the Project:

No additional dependencies are required since all libraries (SwiperJS, Font Awesome) are loaded via CDN.
Simply open code2.html in a web browser:open code2.html

Or drag and drop the file into your browser.


Ensure Assets are Available:

The website references external assets (images, PDFs) like Image1.jpeg, Certificate1.pdf, etc. Ensure these files are in the same directory as code2.html or update the file paths in the HTML to match your setup.


Optional: Serve Locally:

To simulate a web server (recommended for testing Formspree or relative paths), use a tool like live-server:npm install -g live-server
live-server
